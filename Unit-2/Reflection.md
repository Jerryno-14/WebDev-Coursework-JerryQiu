In Unit 2, I learned about storytelling in the Design Thinking process. Storytelling is not a separate stage but is used throughout all stages to make designs more user-focused. In the Empathize stage, it helps share users feeling and experiences through stories based on observations. During the Define, storytelling make problem statements clear . In the Ideate phase, it presents ideas in an engaging way, showing how they solve user problems. For prototyping, stories show how solutions work in real life. In testing, user stories give useful feedback. Storytelling also helps teams understand complex ideas. I found it interesting how storytelling connects all stages, making designs more human-centered. I’m looking forward to use this approach to create a website for my client, focusing on users’ needs and experiences.
