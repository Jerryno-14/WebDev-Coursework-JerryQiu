In Unit 5, I first learned CSS, which is a code specifically designed to add aesthetic elements to HTML. By listing the content and styles separately, I was able to organize and see the code more clearly and intuitively, such as using selectors to adjust the color, spacing, and layout of elements. However, I encountered some problems when debugging the styles. Sometimes the style coverage did not meet expectations, which forced me to adjust the code repeatedly, and sometimes I had to ask AI where my problem was. This made me realize that I needed to have a deeper understanding of the CSS cascading rules. Through this study, I have a new understanding of how to make web pages more beautiful and professional. I see that I will learn more complex CSS properties in the following courses, such as Flexbox and Grid layout.
