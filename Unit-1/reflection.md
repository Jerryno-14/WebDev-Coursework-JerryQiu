In Unit 1, I began my journey into web development, which was completely new to me. I learned about the history of web development from the 1960s to the 2000s. It started with the first appearance of the internet, then the birth of the World Wide Web, and finally, the rapid growth of web usage, which made the internet so popular. This history helped me understand how the web became what it is today. Next, I studied the basic structure of HTML and found out that tags are one of the most important parts of building a web page. Tags act like instructions that tell the browser how to show content. I practiced using simple tags, like the ones for bold text and paragraphs, and saw how they shape a webpage. Learning these basics was exciting, and I realized how powerful tags are in creating websites. I feel motivated to keep learning and improving my skills in web development.
