Unit 4 introduced me to HTML style design, and I learned how to add some beautification to these web pages through tags and attributes. I realized that HTML is not only a structural tool, but also can directly affect the visual effect through inline styles. I tried different fonts, colors, and layouts according to the tutorial. However, the beautification effect of HTML is very limited, and the code can easily become messy.
Through practice, I have a preliminary understanding of the beauty of web design, but I also realize that more systematic tools are needed to manage styles. Next, I look forward to learning CSS so that I can achieve complex visual effects more efficiently while keeping the code concise.
