Unit 6 focuses on customer feedback and iteration. I learned how to accept and apply feedback from customers to improve the projects I designed for customers. These opinions from customers made me realize that my initial design had shortcomings in user experience, such as the page content was not intuitive enough and the color matching was a bit confusing. Through multiple adjustments, I improved the page layout and optimized the interaction process, which gave me a deeper understanding of the "user-centered" design concept. However, frequent modifications also annoyed me, and sometimes I needed to adjust the direction quickly. In the end, the customer was satisfied with the improved version, which gave me more confidence. In the future, I hope to record and plan more systematically when receiving feedback, avoid repeated modifications, and improve iteration efficiency.
