In Unit 3, I participated in my first client project, and the real needs made me feel the challenges in actual development. I tried to understand the client's expectations through this interactive website and transform them into executable solutions. Through this experience, I realized that it might be difficult for me to understand the web design that the client wanted to achieve through the client's unilateral explanation, so frequent communication between the two parties is required in actual application, but I also realized that there is room for improvement in my code structure.
